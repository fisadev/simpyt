# v1.0.1

- Hotfix: make keys in actions case insensitive (it was supposed to be like that, but there was a bug in the valid keys check)

# v1.0.0

- First release!! :) This initial Simpyt version supports:
    - Using phone/tablets as button boxes (with configirable button pages), with visually customizable buttons (color, size, position, text, image, etc).
    - Using midi devices as button boxes (reading notes and encoders)
    - Simulating key presses, fake joystick axes, run commands and even scripts.
